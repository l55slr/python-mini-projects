# 🐍 Python Mini Projects

A collection of small Python projects I built while learning the fundamentals of programming.  
This repo includes simple apps like calculators, games, and practice exercises that helped me understand Python step by step.

## 🚀 How to Run a Project

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed  
2. Open any project folder  
3. Run the script:

\`\`\`bash
python filename.py
\`\`\`

Or run it directly in VS Code / PyCharm.
